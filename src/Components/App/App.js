I personally coded the Arduino to coordinate input and output between the LED matrix and the microphone. I also soldered and wired the components. This taught me a lot about the Arduino platform and the associated circuitry since I had never really worked with these kinds of tools before. We ended up winning the prize for Most Entertaining Hack, and I had a great time!",

The backend was written in Python (FastAPI and BeautifulSoup) and hosted using Heroku, and the dialog agent was developed and trained using Google DialogFlow. This was my first experience building a real-world dialog agent, even with a high-level tool like DialogFlow, meaning I had to learn about intents, entities, and how to establish conversational flows.
